Gameblabla's Oswan
=======================

Gameblabla's Oswan is a Wonderswan/Wonderswan color, based on OswanJ by bird_may_nike and Oswan by Alekmaul.

It can play most, if not all Wonderswan games properly. (except some B&W games)

It used to be based on Alekmaul's Oswan port but significant modifications were done to it.

This fork is also even more accurate than upstream : 

Games are now playing at the proper speed,  

games like Klonoa and Beatmania now sound closer to real hardware.

A stripped-down version of Minizip is provided as well. 

Minizip is licensed under a 3-clause BSD license.

The source code (especially the front-end) is incredibly hacked-up : 

i miss the days where the source code was nice and clean...

COMPATIBILITY
=================

The only problematic games are Pocket Figher and the One Piece games : they have some graphical glitches.

Sound is far from accurate. (not even Mednafen is close to real hardware)

COMPILLING
=================

In all cases, i'm compilling the binaries on a GNU/Linux PC.

GCW0:
Make sure you have the precompiled SDK binaries installed somewhere and point its bin directory to PATH.

Then just do a make -f Makefile.gcw0

Wii:
You need to have the DevkitPPC binaries somewhere and point its bin directory to PATH.

Make sure you have libogc and LibSDL libraries !

Then just do : make -f Makefile.wii

Nspire:
Just install the ndless devkit (or compile the toolchain with their script).

Then do a make -f Makefile.nspire

MinGW:
Install the MingW packages provided by your distribution.

Make sure to compile libSDL with it and put them in MinGW paths.

Then do a make -f Makefile.mingw

CREDITS
